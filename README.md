# YouTube Error Screens Archive

Below is a list of known YouTube error pages, along with short descriptions and notes. The archive includes both active and deprecated pages.

---

## 1) `https://www.youtube.com/oops`

**Description:** Previously displayed the “Oops! Something went wrong” message. Today, most users are redirected to the homepage or a generic 404 page.

**Notes:**

* Sometimes appeared during login or playback failures.

---

## 2) `https://www.youtube.com/404`

**Description:** The classic 404 page featuring YouTube’s humorous theme: “A team of highly trained monkeys has been dispatched.”

**Notes:**

* Appears when a page cannot be found or the URL is invalid.

---

## 3) `https://www.youtube.com/error` (deprecated)

**Description:** Used for testing or general error display in the past; now usually redirects or returns a blank page.

---

## 4) `https://www.youtube.com/500`

**Description:** Internal Server Error page used for backend failures, often with the same “monkey team” error theme.

---

## 5) `https://www.youtube.com/unavailable`

**Description:** Previously shown when videos or content were unavailable. Modern YouTube now shows in-player messages instead.

---

## 6) `https://www.youtube.com/maintenance` (rare)

**Description:** Displayed during maintenance periods; rarely used today.

---

## 7) `https://www.youtube.com/thispagedoesnotexist` (example broken URL)

**Description:** Random invalid URLs redirect to `/404` or the homepage; in-player errors like “This video is unavailable” are handled separately.

## Extra Notes and Common Error Messages

* **“This video is unavailable” / “Video unavailable”** — The video was deleted, restricted, or region-blocked.
* **“Something went wrong. Refresh or try again later.”** — Generic error suggesting retry.
* Many older error pages now redirect or are hidden depending on device or region.

If you’d like, I can:

* Collect **live screenshots** of these pages and add them to the archive.
* Turn this into a **single downloadable HTML page**.
